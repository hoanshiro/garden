## Overview
 > [!faq]- Why need know it?
> - Have better confident about their own ideas => Better storing
> - The manner research tells that field itself
> - Aware process to validate social information
## 2.1 Common kinds of performance tasks
### Performance task
- vary in complexity from word recall to puzzle-solving to assess cognitive process such as 
	- retention: total time hypothesis, forgetting curve
	- recall: paired-associate technique
-  Selective Interference Tasks
	- Introducing a dual task to understand which factors affect primary task
### Performance Measurement
- Type of Measurement:
	- Accuracy: quantity or quality of correct responses -> assess retained information
	- Efficiency: How quickly response time -> assess process and retrieve information (familiarity)
	- Meta-memory judgments: Confidence ratings,ease-of-learning, judgment-of-learning, feelings of knowing -> assess self-reports learning & memory abilities
	- Brain activity:track the tiny waves of electricity/blood level fMRI or EEG to monitor brain activity -> neural mechanism 
=> Highlights areas where participants struggle, informing instructional strategies
## 2.2 Three common research designs
### Surveys and Interviews
- **Subjectivity:** Participants' responses may be influenced by biases, social desirability, or lack of self-awareness.
- **Accuracy:** Participants may not accurately recall or report their experiences.
- **Limited generalizability:** Findings may not be applicable to a wider population.
- **Response rates:** Surveys and interviews often have low response rates, which can limit the representativeness of the sample.
###  Memory Diaries
 - case studies - researcher is the only participant in the study
 - selection bias (a process for selecting items that is not truly random) in terms of which data are collected
-  **Potential for in-depth analysis:** Researchers can analyze the content of the diary entries to gain a deeper understanding of memory.
### Experiments
**Advantages of Experiments:**
- **Control:** Researchers can control experimental conditions to eliminate confounding factors.
- **Causal inferences:** Experiments allow researchers to make causal inferences about the effects of independent variables on dependent variables.
- **Generalizability:** Findings from experiments can be generalized to other populations under similar conditions.
- **Hypothesis testing:** Experiments enable researchers to test specific hypotheses about learning and memory.
**Disadvantages of Experiments:**
- **Artificiality:** Experimental conditions may not accurately reflect real-world situations.
- **Participant bias:** Participants may behave differently when they know they are being observed.
- **Ethical concerns:** Some experiments may raise ethical concerns, such as the use of deceptive measures.
### Summarize
1. **Surveys and Interviews:**
   * Collect data through questionnaires or interviews.
   * Advantages: Quick and inexpensive, can reach a wide range of participants.
   * Disadvantages: Limited to self-reported information, may be biased by participant attitudes and motivations.
2. **Memory Diaries:**
   * Participants record their own memories over time.
   * Advantages: Provides a longitudinal perspective, allows for detailed and authentic memory accounts.
   * Disadvantages: Prone to bias and selective memory, can be time-consuming for participants.
3. **Experiments:**
   * Manipulate independent variables to examine their effects on dependent variables.
   * Advantages: Provide strong evidence for causal relationships, allow for control over experimental conditions.
   * Disadvantages: Can be artificial and may not reflect real-world situations, may raise ethical concerns.
## 2.3 Key Issues in Evaluating the Quality of Research
* **Validity:**
   * Does the study measure what it claims to measure?
* **Reliability:**
   * Are the results consistent and stable?
* **Generalizability:**
   * Can the findings be applied to other populations or settings?
* **Sample Bias:**
   * Is the sample representative of the population of interest?
* **Expectancy Effects:**
   * Are the results influenced by the experimenter's expectations?
* **Ethical Concerns:**
   * Does the study adhere to ethical guidelines and protect the well-being of participants?
