## The Case of H.M.
- **Neurosurgeon** cut 2 slivers from hippocampus of Henry Molaison (try to relieve seizures)
	=> lost ability to form new memories

=> Illustrate the dramatic importance of the biological support for learning and memory.
## 3.1 How Neurons Communicate: Neurotransmission
- **Neurons** are the fundamental units of communication in the nervous system, responsible for transmitting information through electrical and chemical signals
- **Neurotransmission** involves the release of neurotransmitters, chemicals that facilitate communication between neurons
### Key Concepts for Learning and Memory
- **Action Potential:** A rapid electrical impulse that travels down the axon of a neuron.
- **Synapse:** The junction between neurons where neurotransmitters are released.
- **Dendrites:** Extensions of neurons that receive neurotransmitters.
- **Neurotransmitters:** Chemicals released by neurons to activate or inhibit other neurons.

## 3.2 How Neurons Adapt to Support Learning
### Overview
- Neurons adapt to strengthen or modify connections with other neurons in response to experience, supporting learning and memory.
- These adaptations can occur at the level of the synapse, the dendrites, or through the creation of new neurons.
### Key Concepts for Learning and Memory
- **Synaptic Long-Term Potentiation (LTP):** A strengthening of the synapse that allows for increased neurotransmitter release, enhancing the connection between neurons.
- **Synaptic Long-Term Depression (LTD):** A weakening of the synapse that reduces neurotransmitter release, diminishing the connection between neurons.
	=> Practice an activity or skill repeatedly to strengthen the neural connections involved. -> Muscle memory
- **Changes in Dendrite Structure:** Neurons can grow new dendrites or modify existing ones to increase the number of synapses available for communication.
- **Neurogenesis:** The creation of new neurons, which can contribute to the formation of new neural circuits and facilitate learning.
	=> Create a stimulating and enriching environment by exposing yourself to diverse experiences, learning new skills, and connecting with others.
## 3.3 Classical Conditioning
**Definition:** A form of associative learning in which a neutral stimulus becomes associated with a meaningful stimulus, leading to a conditioned response.
### Key Concepts
* **Neutral Stimulus (NS):** A stimulus that initially does not trigger a specific response.
* **Unconditioned Stimulus (US):** A stimulus that naturally triggers a specific response (unconditioned response).
* **Unconditioned Response (UR):** The natural response elicited by the unconditioned stimulus.
* **Conditioned Stimulus (CS):** The neutral stimulus that, after being paired with the US, elicits a similar response.
* **Conditioned Response (CR):** The response elicited by the conditioned stimulus.

### Process of Classical Conditioning:
1. **Pairing:** The neutral stimulus is repeatedly paired with the unconditioned stimulus.
2. **Acquisition:** The neutral stimulus begins to elicit a conditioned response.
3. **Extinction:** If the unconditioned stimulus is no longer paired with the conditioned stimulus, the conditioned response will gradually weaken and eventually disappear.
4. **Spontaneous Recovery:** After extinction, the conditioned response may reappear after a period of time.
### Applications in Learning and Memory
* Shaping behaviors through association (e.g., associating a sound with a reward)
* Creating attitudes and preferences (e.g., associating a brand with positive emotions)
* Treating phobias (e.g., pairing a feared object with a relaxing stimulus)
### Enhancement of Learning and Memory
* **Chunking:** Breaking down information into smaller, manageable units.
* **Spaced Repetition:** Reviewing material at increasing intervals to strengthen memories.
* **Active Retrieval:** Recalling information from memory to reinforce it.
## 3.4 Skill Learning
**Definition:** The process of acquiring and developing motor skills through practice and repetition.
### Key Elements:
* **Practice:** Repeated performance of a skill to improve proficiency.
* **Feedback:** Information that indicates how well a skill is being performed, allowing for adjustments and corrections.
### Phases of Skill Learning:
1. **Cognitive Phase:** Understanding the task and gathering information about it.
2. **Associative Phase:** Developing a connection between the movement and the desired outcome.
3. **Autonomous Phase:** Performing the skill automatically with minimal conscious thought.

### Optimizing Skill Learning
* **Purposeful Practice:** Engaging in deliberate and focused practice that targets specific areas for improvement.
* **Variety of Practice:** Incorporating different variations of the skill to enhance adaptability and flexibility.
* **Feedback:** Providing timely and specific feedback to guide learning and identify errors.
* **Mental Imagery:** Visualizing successful performance to enhance motor representations.
* **Chunking:** Breaking down complex skills into smaller, manageable units.
### Enhancing Learning and Memory
* **Distributed Practice:** Spacing out practice sessions over time, rather than cramming, to enhance retention.
* **Interleaving:** Mixing different skills or topics during practice to improve generalization and retrieval.
* **Elaboration:** Connecting new information to existing knowledge to strengthen memories
## 3.5 Implicit Learning
**Definition:** The unconscious acquisition of knowledge, skills, or associations without explicit instruction or conscious awareness.
### Characteristics
* **Automatic:** Occurs without conscious effort or intention.
* **Incremental:** Learning accumulates gradually over time through repeated exposure.
* **Context-dependent:** Retrieval of learned information is influenced by the context in which the learning occurred.
* **Difficult to verbalize:** Learners may not be able to articulate what they have learned.
### Types of Implicit Learning
* **Procedural Learning:** Acquiring motor skills and sequences of actions (e.g., playing a sport).
* **Priming:** Facilitated recognition or recall of information that has been previously encountered.
* **Statistical Learning:** Detecting patterns and regularities in the environment without explicit instruction.
### Applications in Learning and Memory Enhancement
* **Exposure to Language:** Early and frequent exposure to language can promote implicit language learning, improving vocabulary and grammar.
* **Skill Acquisition:** Practicing skills in a variety of contexts enhances implicit learning and skill retention.
* **Chunking:** Breaking down information into smaller units can facilitate implicit learning by reducing the cognitive load.
* **Mnemonics:** Using memory aids such as rhymes or acronyms can implicitly improve recall.
